## ✅ **Real-World CI/CD Interview Questions** (Asked by CTOs/Tech Leads)

**for a Senior Ruby on Rails Developer**, with smart ways to answer.

---

### 🚀 **Q1. Walk me through how your CI/CD pipeline is set up for your Rails app.**

**Answer:**

> Sure. We use GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
>
> * On every PR or push, our pipeline triggers the following jobs:
>
>   1. **Linting** – using RuboCop, ERB Lint, and Brakeman
>   2. **Dependency install** – Ruby gems (`bundle install`), Yarn packages
>   3. **Database setup** – `rails db:create db:schema:load` for RSpec
>   4. **Test execution** – RSpec in parallel using `--only-group` or `CI_NODE_TOTAL/CI_NODE_INDEX` envs
>   5. **Build & precompile assets**
>   6. **Deployment** – triggered on `main` branch to staging/production via Capistrano or Heroku deploy step
> * We also cache gems and node modules to improve performance.
> * Secrets are managed via GitHub secrets.
>
> On production deployment, we have Slack notifications and Honeybadger monitoring to detect errors early.

---

### 🛡️ **Q2. How do you ensure that only tested code gets deployed to production?**

**Answer:**

> We enforce:
>
> * **Branch protection rules** on `main`: CI must pass before merging.
> * **Test coverage thresholds** using `SimpleCov` + CI fail if coverage drops.
> * Optional **manual approval** step before deploying to prod (`environment: production, requires: reviewers` in GitHub Actions).
> * PRs require at least 1 approval and pass all checks.
>
> This prevents untested or broken code from reaching production.

---

### 🧪 **Q3. Your test suite is getting slow in CI. What would you do?**

**Answer:**

> * First, analyze slow tests with `RSpec --profile` or `test-prof`.
> * Use `parallel_tests` or CI-native parallelism to run specs concurrently.
> * Cache `bundle` and `node_modules` across jobs to reduce setup time.
> * Avoid `db:seed` if not needed in test setup.
> * Use transaction-based DB cleaning instead of truncation.
> * Separate heavy feature/system tests into their own job (e.g., smoke suite).
>
> These changes usually reduce CI time by 40-60%.

---

### 🔐 **Q4. How do you manage secrets (e.g., AWS, Stripe keys) securely in CI/CD?**

**Answer:**

> We never commit secrets to code.
>
> * For GitHub Actions, we store them in **Settings > Secrets**.
> * In the Rails app, we access them via `ENV['STRIPE_SECRET']`.
> * For local dev, we use `dotenv` or `Rails credentials` (`config/credentials/production.key`).
> * Secrets are rotated periodically and access is restricted per role.
>
> In sensitive pipelines (e.g., prod deploy), we add masked secrets + audit logs.

### 🧵 **Q5. Can you share a sample GitHub Actions workflow for Rails CI/CD?**

Absolutely! Here's a **production-grade GitHub Actions setup** for a typical Rails app:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Rails CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgres:13
        env:
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
        ports: ['5432:5432']
        options: >-
          --health-cmd pg_isready
          --health-interval 10s
          --health-timeout 5s
          --health-retries 5

    env:
      RAILS_ENV: test
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/myapp_test

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: 3.2
          bundler-cache: true

      - name: Set up Node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          bundle install --jobs 4 --retry 3
          yarn install --check-files

      - name: Set up DB
        run: |
          bin/rails db:create db:schema:load

      - name: Run RuboCop
        run: bundle exec rubocop

      - name: Run RSpec tests
        run: bundle exec rspec

  deploy:
    needs: build-and-test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: production
      url: https://myapp.example.com

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Deploy to Heroku (or use Capistrano here)
        uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12
        with:
          heroku_api_key: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY }}
          heroku_app_name: "myapp-prod"
          heroku_email: "devops@example.com"
```

Let me know if your project uses Docker, Capistrano, ECS, or Kubernetes — I can customize it accordingly.

### 📦 **Q6. How do you deploy assets in CI/CD?**

**Answer:**

> For Heroku, it’s handled automatically.
>
> For non-Heroku:
>
> * We use `RAILS_ENV=production bin/rails assets:precompile` during CI
> * Then upload assets to S3 or copy to the server via `scp` or Capistrano
> * Set `config.assets.compile = false` and `config.public_file_server.enabled = true`
>
> We fingerprint assets to enable long-term caching.

---

### 🧯 **Q7. How do you rollback a bad deployment in your CI/CD setup?**

**Answer:**

> * For Heroku: `heroku releases:rollback`
> * For Capistrano: `cap production deploy:rollback`
> * For Docker/K8s: `kubectl rollout undo deployment/my-app`
>
> Additionally, we:
>
> * Monitor deploy success with healthchecks
> * Tag each release so we can easily rollback via Git
> * Alert the team via Slack on failure

============================================================================================
Here are **CI/CD interview questions** along with **detailed answers** tailored for a **Senior Ruby on Rails Developer** role:

---

### **1. What is CI/CD and why is it important in a Rails project?**

**Answer:**
CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery**.
In a Rails project:

* **CI (Continuous Integration)** ensures that every code change is tested automatically, helping catch issues early by running tests, linters, and code analysis.
* **CD (Continuous Deployment/Delivery)** allows us to deploy code automatically to staging or production, reducing manual errors and increasing release speed.
  It’s important because Rails projects tend to evolve quickly, and CI/CD helps maintain code quality, stability, and consistent delivery.

---

### **2. What does a typical CI/CD pipeline for a Rails app look like?**

**Answer:**
A typical Rails CI/CD pipeline includes:

1. **Checkout code**
2. **Install dependencies** – Ruby gems via `bundle install`, JS packages via `yarn`
3. **Run linters** – RuboCop, ERB Lint, Brakeman
4. **Run tests** – RSpec, Minitest, or Cucumber
5. **Database setup** – create, migrate, and seed the test DB
6. **Run code coverage and upload results**
7. **Build assets (if needed)**
8. **Deploy** – to staging or production via Capistrano, Heroku, or Terraform pipelines

---

### **3. How do you manage environment variables and secrets in CI/CD pipelines?**

**Answer:**

* Use CI/CD tool’s **secret management**:

  * GitHub Actions: store secrets in **Settings > Secrets**
  * GitLab CI: use **CI/CD variables**
* Never hardcode secrets in code or YAML files.
* Use libraries like `dotenv`, `figaro`, or `Rails.application.credentials` to access secrets in the app.
* Rotate secrets periodically and audit access.

---

### **4. How do you run RSpec tests in a CI pipeline?**

**Answer:**
In tools like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI:

```bash
bundle install
RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rake db:create db:schema:load
bundle exec rspec
```

In `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    bundle install
    bin/rails db:create db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=test
    bundle exec rspec
```

Additionally, I ensure parallel testing using `parallel_tests` gem or CI-native features to speed up execution.

---

### **5. How do you deploy a Rails app via CI/CD?**

**Answer:**
Depends on the platform:

**For Heroku:**

* Use the Heroku CLI and API tokens in GitHub Actions:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Heroku
  uses: akhileshns/heroku-deploy@v3.12.12
  with:
    heroku_api_key: ${{ secrets.HEROKU_API_KEY }}
    heroku_app_name: "my-app"
    heroku_email: "my-email@example.com"
```

**For EC2/Capistrano:**

* Use SSH with private keys stored in secrets.
* Run `cap production deploy` as the final deployment step.

**For Docker/Kubernetes:**

* Build Docker image → Push to DockerHub → Deploy via Helm or kubectl.

---

### **6. How do you handle database migrations in CI/CD?**

**Answer:**
I run `rails db:migrate` automatically during deployment. To avoid downtime:

* Use **non-blocking migrations** (e.g., add columns with default null, not non-null constraints immediately).
* In production, sometimes wrap migrations in a **review step**.
* Run `rake db:prepare` in Rails 7+ for auto-creating, migrating and seeding.

---

### **7. How do you handle rollbacks in your deployment process?**

**Answer:**

* For Heroku, I use `heroku releases:rollback`.
* For Capistrano, I run `cap production deploy:rollback`.
* In more advanced setups (like Kubernetes), I use versioned Docker images and Helm chart rollbacks.

I also log every release and use monitoring tools (like Sentry or Honeybadger) to trigger alerts, so we can quickly rollback when needed.

---

### **8. How do you monitor deployments and catch production issues early?**

**Answer:**

* Use **error tracking**: Sentry, Honeybadger, or Rollbar
* Use **performance monitoring**: New Relic, Skylight, or Scout
* Add **post-deploy checks** in CI: hit a health endpoint after deployment
* Send **Slack notifications** or create alerts for deployment success/failure

---

### **9. What are some challenges you faced with CI/CD and how did you solve them?**

**Answer:**

* **Slow pipelines**: Split test suites using `parallel_tests`, cache dependencies using `actions/cache`, and avoid rebuilding assets unnecessarily.
* **Flaky tests**: Isolate the failing test, retry logic in CI, and fix race conditions or dependency on time.
* **Secret mismanagement**: Accidentally exposing secrets in logs—fixed by masking them and rotating keys.
* **Migration downtime**: Solved by using zero-downtime-safe migration strategies.

---

### **10. How do you handle different deployment environments (staging, production, etc.) in CI/CD?**

**Answer:**

* Use separate GitHub Actions workflows or `if:` conditions to deploy on `main` (production) and `develop` (staging).
* Use different environment variables and secrets for each environment.
* Rails handles this via `RAILS_ENV=staging` or `RAILS_ENV=production`.
* Ensure config like `config/environments/staging.rb` is properly set.
