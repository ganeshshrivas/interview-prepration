## üîç When to Choose **PostgreSQL**

* You need **complex joins and relational integrity.**
* Your app is **transaction-heavy** (banking, inventory management).
* You need **advanced queries, aggregations, or GIS (geolocation) features.**
* You need **reliable schema enforcement.**

### Example:

* Banking apps, payment systems, analytics platforms, marketplaces.

---

## üîç When to Choose **MySQL**

* You need a **lightweight, fast CRUD system** with simple relationships.
* You are working on **small-to-medium size web applications.**
* You need a database that is **easy to set up and cheap to host.**

### Example:

* CMS (WordPress, Joomla), small SaaS apps, blogging platforms.

---

## üîç When to Choose **MongoDB**

* You need to **handle large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data.**
* You require **fast, scalable horizontal growth (NoSQL scaling).**
* You have **flexible schema requirements** (user-generated content, IoT, logs).
* You need **real-time analytics** or store big JSON-like objects.

### Example:

* IoT platforms, social networks, ride-sharing apps, product catalogs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Summary:

* **PostgreSQL:** Best for complex relational data, transactions, and advanced querying.
* **MySQL:** Best for simpler relational use-cases and fast CRUD apps.
* **MongoDB:** Best for document storage, schema-less data, and large-scale applications needing flexibility and scalability.
