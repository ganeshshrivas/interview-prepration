Sure — let’s walk through the **SOLID principles** in a **Rails** context with clear examples.

---

## **S** — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

> A class should have **one reason to change**.

**Bad example** – `User` model doing too much:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
  def send_welcome_email
    UserMailer.welcome_email(self).deliver_later
  end

  def calculate_discount
    # some discount calculation logic
  end
end
```

Here, `User` is both:

* Sending emails
* Handling business logic for discounts

---

**Good example** – Move responsibilities to dedicated classes:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
end

class WelcomeEmailService
  def self.send_to(user)
    UserMailer.welcome_email(user).deliver_later
  end
end

class DiscountCalculator
  def self.for(user)
    # discount logic
  end
end
```

Now, each class has **one responsibility**.

---

## **O** — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

> Software entities should be **open for extension** but **closed for modification**.

**Bad example** – Adding new payment methods requires editing existing class:

```ruby
class PaymentProcessor
  def process(order, type)
    if type == :stripe
      # stripe logic
    elsif type == :paypal
      # paypal logic
    end
  end
end
```

Every time we add a new payment method, we must modify this class.

---

**Good example** – Use polymorphism:

```ruby
class PaymentProcessor
  def process(order, gateway)
    gateway.process(order)
  end
end

class StripeGateway
  def process(order)
    # stripe logic
  end
end

class PaypalGateway
  def process(order)
    # paypal logic
  end
end
```

Now you can **add new gateways** without changing `PaymentProcessor`.

---

## **L** — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

> Subtypes must be **substitutable** for their base types.

**Bad example** – Child class breaking expectations:

```ruby
class Report
  def generate
    # generates report
  end
end

class EmptyReport < Report
  def generate
    raise "Not supported"
  end
end
```

Calling `generate` on `EmptyReport` breaks the expectation.

---

**Good example** – Respect the contract:

```ruby
class Report
  def generate
    raise NotImplementedError
  end
end

class PDFReport < Report
  def generate
    # PDF generation logic
  end
end

class CSVReport < Report
  def generate
    # CSV generation logic
  end
end
```

All subclasses **honor** the `generate` method.

---

## **I** — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

> Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

In Ruby, this often means **not making “fat” modules** that force classes to implement unused methods.

**Bad example**:

```ruby
module Reportable
  def generate_pdf; end
  def generate_csv; end
  def generate_html; end
end

class CSVReport
  include Reportable
  def generate_pdf; end # unused
  def generate_html; end # unused
end
```

**Good example** – Split interfaces:

```ruby
module PDFExportable
  def generate_pdf; end
end

module CSVExportable
  def generate_csv; end
end

class CSVReport
  include CSVExportable
end
```

---

## **D** — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

> Depend on abstractions, not on concrete implementations.

**Bad example** – Controller directly instantiates concrete class:

```ruby
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    gateway = StripeGateway.new
    gateway.charge(params[:amount])
  end
end
```

**Good example** – Inject dependency:

```ruby
class PaymentsController < ApplicationController
  def create
    gateway = PaymentGatewayFactory.build(:stripe)
    gateway.charge(params[:amount])
  end
end

class PaymentGatewayFactory
  def self.build(type)
    case type
    when :stripe then StripeGateway.new
    when :paypal then PaypalGateway.new
    end
  end
end
```

The controller **depends on an abstraction** (`PaymentGatewayFactory`) instead of a specific gateway.

==================================================================================================================

Let’s break these three down in a **systems / performance** context, and I’ll also give you easy analogies so they stick.

---

## **1. Latency** – *"How long does it take for one request?"*

* **Definition**: The **time delay** between when a request is made and when the response is received.
* **Unit**: milliseconds (ms) or seconds (s).
* **Focus**: *Speed of a single operation*.
* **Example**: In Rails, if an API endpoint takes **250ms** to return JSON, that’s its latency.

**Analogy**: How long it takes for a single pizza order to be delivered once you call.

---

## **2. Throughput** – *"How many requests can we handle per second?"*

* **Definition**: The **number of units of work** the system can process in a given time.
* **Unit**: requests per second (RPS), transactions per second (TPS), or MB/sec.
* **Focus**: *Capacity of the system*.
* **Example**: Your Rails app can process **500 API requests per second** under load.

**Analogy**: How many pizzas the restaurant can deliver in one hour.

---

## **3. Threshold** – *"The limit before performance changes or failure occurs"*

* **Definition**: A **preset limit** for a metric (like latency, error rate, CPU, or throughput) beyond which the system takes an action (e.g., alert, throttle, reject).
* **Unit**: Depends on the metric being measured.
* **Focus**: *Boundaries for acceptable performance*.
* **Example**:

  * **Latency threshold**: 300ms — if exceeded, trigger an alert.
  * **Throughput threshold**: 1000 RPS — if exceeded, start rate limiting.

**Analogy**: The restaurant can only make **200 pizzas per hour** — after that, they stop accepting new orders until the next hour.

### Quick Comparison Table

| Term           | What it Measures                      | Typical Unit     | Focus         | Analogy                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Latency**    | Time to complete one request          | ms, s            | Speed         | Time to deliver one pizza        |
| **Throughput** | Number of requests processed per time | RPS, TPS, MB/s   | Capacity      | Pizzas delivered per hour        |
| **Threshold**  | Limit before action is taken          | ms, RPS, % usage | Limit control | Max pizzas/hour before rejecting |
