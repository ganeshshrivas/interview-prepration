In a **Rails application**, the terms **application server** and **web server** refer to two different layers of the system architecture, each with its own role.

Let’s break them down:

---

## 🔸 1. Web Server

### ✅ Purpose:

* Handles **HTTP requests** from the client (browser).
* Serves **static content** (images, CSS, JS files) directly.
* Forwards **dynamic requests** (like Rails routes) to the application server.

### ✅ Examples:

* **Nginx**
* **Apache**

### ✅ In Rails:

When you deploy a Rails app, Nginx or Apache usually sits **in front of** the application server.

* It handles things like:

  * Load balancing
  * Caching static assets
  * Managing HTTPS/SSL
  * Forwarding requests to the application server

---

## 🔸 2. Application Server

### ✅ Purpose:

* Runs your **Rails code**.
* Processes dynamic requests (like database queries, business logic, API calls).
* Generates dynamic HTML, JSON, etc.

### ✅ Examples:

* **Puma** (default in Rails now)
* **Unicorn** (older but still used)
* **Passenger** (can also act as a web server)

### ✅ In Rails:

* The **application server** spins up Rails processes (workers/threads) and serves the actual app logic.
* It connects to the database, executes Ruby code, and builds the HTTP response that is sent back to the web server.

## 🔸 Summary Table

| Feature      | Web Server                   | Application Server             |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Purpose      | Handles HTTP/S, static files | Runs app code, processes logic |
| Examples     | Nginx, Apache                | Puma, Unicorn, Passenger       |
| Typical Role | Reverse proxy, asset server  | Serves Rails requests          |
| Connection   | Listens on port 80/443       | Listens on port 3000/8080      |

## ✅ In Development (Rails server command)

When you run:

```bash
rails server
```

Rails uses **Puma by default** and acts as both:

* A **basic web server** for static assets.
* An **application server** for Rails requests.

In production, they are usually **separated**:

* Nginx as web server
* Puma as application server
