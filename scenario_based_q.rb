################# i have two instace of ec2 running i want my query only go to first instance when load comming in rails
=============================================

✅ Option A: Use Target Groups and Route to Only One Instance
Go to EC2 > Load Balancers in the AWS Console.

Select your Load Balancer.

Click on Target Groups.

Edit targets:

Deregister the second EC2 instance.

Leave only the first EC2 instance registered.

Save changes.

✅ Now all traffic will go to only the first instance

=======================================================

✅ Option B: Use Routing Rules (If ALB + Path-based Routing)
Add a listener rule in ALB:

If host is my-api-primary.example.com → Forward to first instance target group


🔧 SCENARIO 2: Youre Connecting Directly (Not Using a Load Balancer)
=======================================================================


Then just point your Rails backend/API/frontend directly to the private IP or DNS of the first EC2 instance:

# For example, in your Rails app config:
config.api_endpoint = "http://ec2-1-2-3-4.compute-1.amazonaws.com"

############### how to send milians email in 4-5 timiling and make sure each email delivered properly 


To send **millions of emails** reliably in **4–5 timed batches**, and ensure **high deliverability**, you'll need to architect this properly — both technically and strategically.

---

## ✅ Goals:

1. **Send millions of emails**
2. **Split across 4–5 timed windows**
3. **Ensure deliverability (not spam)**
4. **Monitor bounces, opens, etc.**

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Plan

---

### 🔹 1. **Use a Scalable Email Delivery Service**

Never send millions of emails directly from your server.

Instead, use services designed for high-volume email:

| Service            | Type                      |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Amazon SES         | Cloud, pay-as-you-go      |
| SendGrid           | Transactional & marketing |
| Mailgun            | Developer-friendly        |
| Postmark           | Fast, transactional       |
| Mailchimp, Klaviyo | For campaigns/newsletters |

> ✅ **Amazon SES** is most affordable for millions, but needs careful setup.

---

### 🔹 2. **Use a Job Queue to Schedule Batches**

Split the load across 4–5 batches using a background job system:

#### For Ruby on Rails:

```ruby
# Using Sidekiq
EmailBatchJob.set(wait_until: 2.hours.from_now).perform_later(batch_id)
```

* Use **Sidekiq**, **Resque**, or **Delayed Job**
* Split your mailing list into N batches (e.g., 250k per job)

---

### 🔹 3. **Ensure Deliverability**

To avoid landing in spam folders:

#### ✅ Set Up Domain Authentication

* **SPF**, **DKIM**, and **DMARC** DNS records
* All reputable services (SES, SendGrid) will guide you

#### ✅ Warm up IPs (if using dedicated IPs)

* Start with small volumes
* Gradually increase to build reputation

#### ✅ Clean Your List

* Remove bounced, unsubscribed, inactive users
* Use double opt-in

#### ✅ Avoid Spam Triggers

* No all-caps or spammy subject lines
* Keep HTML clean and readable
* Avoid too many links or images

---

### 🔹 4. **Track Delivery + Bounce Reports**

Make sure your provider supports:

* **Bounce handling**
* **Open and click tracking**
* **Complaint (spam) feedback**

You can use:

* SES: Amazon SNS + Lambda or Webhooks
* SendGrid: Event Webhook
* Mailgun: Webhooks

---

### 🔹 5. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**

Many providers limit your send rate, especially at first.

Example for SES:

* Start limit: 14 emails/sec
* After approval: 50,000 emails per day (can increase to millions)

Split sending based on your **provider's quota**:

* e.g., 1M emails = 5 batches × 200k
* Spread over 4–5 time slots using background jobs or cron

---

### 🔹 6. **Use Templates & Personalization**

* Store templates in your provider or app
* Use variables like `{{name}}`, `{{unsubscribe_url}}`
* Avoid “Hello user,” — personalize!

---

### 🔹 7. **Test Before Sending to Millions**

* Create a **seed list** of test emails on different domains: Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook, custom
* Send test campaigns to them first
* Use [Mail Tester](https://www.mail-tester.com/) to check spam score

## 📦 Tools Summary

| Task               | Tool/Service                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Email delivery     | Amazon SES / SendGrid / Mailgun |
| Background jobs    | Sidekiq / Celery / Gearman      |
| Scheduling batches | Cron / Delayed Job / Sidekiq    |
| Bounce tracking    | SNS (SES), Webhooks             |
| IP warm-up         | Manual or via provider          |
| List cleaning      | NeverBounce, ZeroBounce         |

---

## ✅ Final Checklist

✅ Use a high-volume email provider
✅ Split the mailing list into 4–5 logical batches
✅ Use job queues with scheduled time windows
✅ Authenticate domain (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
✅ Warm up your IPs
✅ Track bounces, opens, spam complaints
✅ Clean email list before sending
✅ Test thoroughly with a seed list
